## Typical AI scenarios and high-risk triggers

- Clinical documentation and ambient scribing
- Clinical decision support and diagnostic imaging triage
- Patient-facing triage and navigation assistants
- Claims, coding and revenue-cycle automation

**Pushes a system into a higher risk tier in Australia:**

- AI that is or is part of a software medical device (TGA, HSA, ANVISA, ANMAT, PMDA, FDA device rules)
- Health data is special-category / sensitive data
